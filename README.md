I'm compiling a list of popular, impressive, awesome and/or community-driven game and game-related GitHub repositories for a pet project of mine. 

I'm looking for everything an anything. Old school text adventures, educational games, 8-bit platform games, browser-based games, indie games, GameJam projects, add-ons/maps/hacks/plugins for commercial games, etc. I'm especially interested in repositories that have strong community involvement and awesome READMEs :-)

If you'd like to help please send me a link to the repository, or fork this repo and submit a pull request. Thank you!
